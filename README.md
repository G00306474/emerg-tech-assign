# Emerging Technologies Project
This project is set up for emerging tech module in my fourth year software devlopment course. It is written using python and juypter notebook.
## Requirements to run project
In order to run this on your own device you will need to install anaconda you can find a guide to install [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html). 

## Downloading the Project
Go to (https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign)
Select Download Zip
Extract the full folder in the target directory
You can then open juypter notebook from the cmder (if you dont have cmder download [here](http://cmder.net/) or use cmd) by navigating to the project directory and enter following command.
$ jupyter notebook

## Notebooks Contents 
1. [Numpy Random Notebook](https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign/blob/master/Numpy.ipynb): a jupyter notebook explaining the concepts
behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots
of the various distributions.
2. [Iris dataset notebook](https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign/blob/master/Iris%20dataset%20notebook.ipynb): a jupyter notebook explaining the famous
iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate
the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.
3. [MNIST dataset notebook](https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign/blob/master/MNIST%20dataset%20notebook.ipynb): a jupyter notebook explaining how to
read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.
4. [Digit recognition script](https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign/blob/master/digitRecScript.py) : a Python script that takes an image file
containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised
learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.
5. [Digit recognition notebook](https://github.com/G00306474/emerg-tech-assign/blob/master/Digit%20recognition%20notebook.ipynb): a jupyter notebook explaining how the
above Python script works and discussing its performance.
